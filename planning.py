    The problem we are facing:

    * Token transactions don't have * or @ symbols 

    * Smart Contract transactions have * , @ , # symbols 

    * Smart Contract transaction of the type one time event have 1 # before colon 

    * Smart Contract transaction of the type continuous event has 2 # after colon 

    * So we are checking for hashes based on the type of smart contract(identified by *) 

    * But the above check disregards checking hashes in token transactions

Allowed formats of Smart Contract and token names 

1. First character should always be an Alphabet, lower case or upper case 
2. The last character should always be an Alphabet, lower case or upper case 
3. The middle characters can be a - or _

Check for FLO Address 

Write checks for conditions inside contract conditions 
Serious error handling for contract-conditions
* 2222:00 gives error 
* contractAmount = 0.022rt gives error | check if space is allowed between 0.022 rt

    What we need for NFT contract code 

    1. NFT-address mapping table in system.db 
    2. New main transaction category class 
    3. New sub-category for transfer category class ie. NFT transfer 


    NFT Smart Contract end cases 
    1. NFT against an address 
    2. NFT against another NFT 
    3. 

    flodata format for NFT 
    Create 1000 NFT with bioscope# with nft-details: (1) name = 'bioscope' (2) hash = 

    Create 100 albumname# as NFT with 2CF24DBA5FB0A30E26E83B2AC5B9E29E1B161E5C1FA7425E73043362938B9824 as asset hash 
    [#]

    Rules
    -----
    DIFFERENT BETWEEN TOKEN AND NFT
    System.db will have a differnent entry
    in creation nft word will be extra
    NFT Hash must be  present
    Creation and transfer amount .. only integer parts will be taken
    Keyword nft must be present in both creation and transfer

Need infinite tokens to create stable coins, so they can be created without worrying about the upper limit of the coins

Create another table in system.db, it simply writes what is every database in one place
